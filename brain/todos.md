## Bootstrap Skill Fixes

20. [ ] Clarify skill-path defaults for repo vs user projects — current default is `.agents/skills`, but bootstrap/docs should explicitly explain repo-internal development vs user-project bootstrapping expectations and where skills are expected to live in each mode.

## Remote Dispatchers

69. [ ] Cursor dispatcher — implement CursorBackend (real HTTP client replacing stub), PollingDispatcher + pollingSession (deferred from plan 27 phase 4), webhook receiver endpoint on Noodle's HTTP server for status change notifications, factory wiring in loop/defaults.go. Flow: push worktree branch → launch Cursor Cloud Agent via API → agent pushes to target branch (no PR) → detect completion via webhook or polling → pull target branch back to worktree. [[plans/69-cursor-dispatcher/overview]]

## UI

77. [ ] Add react-window (https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window) — virtualized list rendering for large datasets

## Backend
83. [ ] Error recoverability taxonomy
84. [ ] Sub-agent tracking — parse Claude/Codex sub-agent lifecycle into canonical events, build agent tree in snapshots, stream activity to UI, and enable user steering. [[plans/84-subagent-tracking/overview]] — define canonical backend failure classes (hard invariant, recoverable backend, scheduler/cook agent mistake, agent-start unrecoverable vs retryable), map loop/start/dispatcher boundaries, and surface typed recoverability metadata for operators.
